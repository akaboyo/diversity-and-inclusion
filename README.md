# [DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION](#diversity-and-inclusion)

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive HR Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard for PwC. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into workforce diversity across various dimensions, including gender, age, job level, and region. It aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making and to support PwC's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Source: 
The dataset was provided by PwC and included detailed information about employees, such as gender, job level, department, region, age, promotion status, turnover, and performance ratings.[03 Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17363017/03.Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx)

### Data Cleaning: 
I began by cleaning the data in Power Query, ensuring that all records were accurate and free of duplicates. Missing values were handled using appropriate imputation techniques.

### Data Transformation: 
The data was then transformed to ensure consistency across various fields. I categorized the information into relevant dimensions, such as job levels, departments, and age groups, to enable comprehensive analysis.
