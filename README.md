## Executive Summary

This project presents a Power BI-driven analysis of workforce diversity and inclusion at a PwC client using a provided HR dataset. The dashboard is designed to help HR leaders and business stakeholders evaluate key diversity metrics across dimensions such as gender, age groups, job levels, promotions, turnover, and performance ratings. 


Through structured data cleansing, transformation in Power Query, and thoughtful visual design in Power BI, the project highlights disparities in promotion rates and performance outcomes between gender groups, identifies patterns in turnover and regional representation, and surfaces actionable insights about diversity gaps across departments and job levels. Interactive filters and visuals support deeper exploration and enable data-driven decision-making to foster a more inclusive workplace. 

This work demonstrates my ability to apply HR analytics techniques, build impactful Power BI dashboards, and translate complex workforce data into clear, strategic insights for diversity and inclusion initiatives.

## Project Objective
This project delivers a **Diversity & Inclusion dashboard** developed in Power BI for a PwC case experience. It explores HR metrics such as gender distribution, promotions, turnover, performance ratings, and regional representation. The goal is to provide leaders with clear insights that support diversity strategy and informed decision-making.

## Business Objective

The main objective of this project is:

- To evaluate workforce diversity using HR data

## Data Preparation

1. Imported the dataset (`03 Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx`) into Power BI  
2. Cleaned and validated fields in Power Query  
3. Standardized formats and handled missing or inconsistent values  
4. Categorized dimensions such as job level, gender, and age groups for analysis

## Dashboard Design and Development

The dashboard comprises two pages:

### ### Page 1 – Diversity Overview:
![diversity1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39eaa275-3dc9-4f8e-a2ad-4976ed6f0b53)

This page provides key metrics and distribution visuals, such as:

- Gender distribution
- Total employees by region
- Turnover rates by gender
- Average performance ratings by gender

### Page 2 – Detailed Breakdowns:
![diversity2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/454e6308-c454-4747-9965-73a546179de4)

This page explores:

- Promotion rates across job levels
- Hiring and turnover trends by department
- Performance outcomes segmented by gender and age group

## Interactivity and Usability:

### Filters: 
Added interactive filters for job level, department, age group, and region to allow users to drill down into specific segments of the workforce and to tailor the analysis based on their interests.
### Cross-filtering: 
Enabled cross-filtering on the visuals, allowing stakeholders to explore relationships between various metrics dynamically.

## Key Insights:
The analysis revealed:

- **Promotion Disparity:** Male employees were promoted more frequently than female employees, especially at senior levels.
- **Turnover Patterns:** Some demographic groups exhibited higher turnover rates, indicating areas for retention focus.
- **Performance Differences:** Average performance ratings had subtle differences between gender groups, prompting further investigation into evaluation practices.
- **Regional Variation:** Certain regions showed noticeable gender diversity imbalances across departments.

This project exemplifies how data visualization can support diversity and inclusion initiatives within a corporate environment. The dashboard not only offers insights into workforce demographics but also serves as a strategic tool for PwC to drive cultural change and promote inclusivity at all organizational levels.
By presenting self-explanatory visualizations and facilitating user interaction, the dashboard empowered HR leaders to make data-driven decisions to foster a more inclusive workplace.
