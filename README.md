# [DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION](#diversity-and-inclusion)

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive HR Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard for PwC. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into workforce diversity across various dimensions, including gender, age, job level, and region. It aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making and to support PwC's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Source: 
The dataset was provided by PwC and included detailed information about employees, such as gender, job level, department, region, age, promotion status, turnover, and performance ratings.[03 Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17363017/03.Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx)

### Data Cleaning: 
I began by cleaning the data in Power Query, ensuring that all records were accurate and free of duplicates. Missing values were handled using appropriate imputation techniques.

### Data Transformation: 
The data was then transformed to ensure consistency across various fields. I categorized the information into relevant dimensions, such as job levels, departments, and age groups, to enable comprehensive analysis.

## Dashboard Design and Development

- Tool Selection: I used Power BI for creating the dashboard due to its powerful visualization capabilities and ease of integration with Excel data.
- Dashboard Layout: I designed a two-page dashboard that offers an intuitive and visually appealing layout. The first page provides an overview of diversity metrics, while the 
  second page dives deeper into specific aspects, such as job level promotions, turnover rates, and performance ratings.

## Visualizations and Insights

### Report 1 - Overview of Diversity Metrics:

- Key Metrics: Displayed key metrics, such as total employees, gender distribution, and turnover rate, along with average performance ratings by gender.
- Promotions and Turnover: Used pie charts and bar charts to highlight the gender breakdown of promotions and leavers, as well as to display employee distribution by age group and region.
- Department-wise Analysis: Provided insights into employee promotions by department, with a focus on gender disparities.


### Report 2 - Detailed Breakdown by Job Level:

- Promotions by Gender and Job Level: Visualized the percentage of promotions by gender across different job levels using bar charts, which allow for comparison between male and female promotion rates.
- Hiring and Promotion Trends: Used line and bar charts to analyze hiring and promotion trends by job level, showing how gender distribution changes across roles.
- Performance Analysis: Analyzed average performance ratings by job level, highlighting differences between promoted and non-promoted employees for both men and women.

## Interactivity and Usability:

### Filters: 
Added interactive filters for job level, department, age group, and region to allow users to drill down into specific segments of the workforce and to tailor the analysis based on their interests.
### Cross-filtering: 
Enabled cross-filtering on the visuals, allowing stakeholders to explore relationships between various metrics dynamically.

## Key Insights:

- The dashboard revealed that male employees were promoted more frequently than female employees, particularly in senior roles.
- There was a noticeable turnover rate among female employees, especially at managerial levels, indicating potential areas for improvement in retention strategies.
- Performance ratings were slightly higher for male employees compared to female employees across most job levels, which could suggest disparities in performance evaluations 
  that might need further investigation.
- Regional insights indicated that Europe and Switzerland had a higher concentration of employees, with noticeable gender diversity gaps in specific departments.

## Conclusion:
This project exemplifies how data visualization can support diversity and inclusion initiatives within a corporate environment. The dashboard not only offers insights into workforce demographics but also serves as a strategic tool for PwC to drive cultural change and promote inclusivity at all organizational levels.
By presenting self-explanatory visualizations and facilitating user interaction, the dashboard empowered HR leaders to make data-driven decisions to foster a more inclusive workplace.
